## Introduction and Data

# imager is used for importing and manipulating data.
# It can take a while to install. If you don't want to
# install it you can skip this section. The data will be
# read in as a CSV later.

library(imager)

# This is the data source. It's from the Toronto Emotional Speech Set. 
# The set consists of both old adult female (OAF) and young adult female (YAF) 
# voice samples saying various words with specific emotions. 
# We'll work with the happy and angry samples

# For classification, audio is converted to an image of a mel spectrogram. 

# load a sample image with imager
sample <- load.image(here('happy/H_OAF_back.png'))
plot(sample)

# The image is actually just a vector of numeric pixel values.
# here are the first 10 pixel values
sample[1:10]

# Each pixel is a feature. In order to reduce the features in
# our data set we can resize the image to reduce the pixel count.
sample <- resize(sample, 32, 32)
plot(sample)

# Now we will resize all images in the data set and add their
# pixel values to a data frame

# set the desired dimensions we will convert the images to
dim1 <- 32
dim2 <- 32

# list images in the happy directory
happy <- list.files(here('happy'), full.names=T)
# instantiate the data frame
happy_df <- data.frame()
# generate column names for the data frame based on the number of pixels in the image
# these pimages will be 32*32 = 1024 pixels. So i create columns named px1......px1024
col_names <- sapply('px', paste, seq(dim1*dim2), sep='')
# load each image, resize it, and then add the vector to the data frame
for(file in happy){
    img <- load.image(file)
    img <- resize(img, dim1, dim2)
    happy_df <- rbind(happy_df, img)
}
# set the column names
colnames(happy_df) <- col_names
# add a label to the data. Happy will be 1 and angry 0
happy_df$label <- 1


# Now repeat the above for the angry spectrograms
angry <- list.files(here('angry'), full.names=T)
# instantiate the data frame
angry_df <- data.frame()
# generate column names
col_names <- sapply('px', paste, seq(dim1*dim2), sep='')
# load each image, resize it, and then add the vector to the data frame
for(file in angry){
    img <- load.image(file)
    img <- resize(img, dim1, dim2)
    angry_df <- rbind(angry_df, img)
}
# set the column names
colnames(angry_df) <- col_names
# add a label to the data
angry_df$label <- 0
